# Sentiment Analysis on 𝕏 (Twitter) Platform

## Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on tweets from the 𝕏 (Twitter) platform. The primary objective is to preprocess the textual data, apply various machine learning algorithms, and evaluate their performance in predicting the sentiment of the tweets.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: Tweets are loaded from a CSV file.
- **Text Cleaning**: Includes lowercasing, removing URLs, special characters, and numbers.
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into tokens.
- **Stop Words Removal and Stemming**: Using NLTK to remove stop words and stem tokens.
- **Output**: Cleaned tweets are saved to a new CSV file.

### 2. Sentiment Labeling
- **Sentiment Assignment**: Tweets are labeled as positive, negative, or neutral and mapped to numerical values (1, -1, 0).
- **Output**: Labeled data is saved to another CSV file.

### 3. Machine Learning Algorithms
- **Model Training**: Various ML algorithms are trained, including:
  - requency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
  -  Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  -  Random Forest (RF)
  -   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  -   Vader
  -   Naive Bayes (NB)
  -   Aboost
  -   Maximum Entropy

### 4. Evaluation
  - Models are evaluated based on accuracy and other metrics.

## 5. Results
The project demonstrates an effective pipeline for sentiment analysis on 𝕏 (Twitter) data, with the Maximum Entropy model achieving an accuracy of 0.807.
